Particle Properties by Design (ppbd) is about utilising big data from the Cambridge structure database (CSD) to train machine learning models capable of predicting experimental conditions required to achieve the desired size, shape and dominant crystal face for any new organic molecule.
The hope is this work will be applicable to the pharmaceutical industry to address issues issues in manufacturing as well as bioavaility that APIs might face due to unfavourable crystal properties
