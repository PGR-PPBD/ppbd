Particle Properties by Design (ppbd) is about utilising big data from the Cambridge structure database (CSD) to train machine learning models capable of predicting experimental conditions required to achieve the desired size, shape and dominant crystal face for any new organic molecule.

The hope is this work will be applicable to the pharmaceutical industry to address issues issues in manufacturing as well as bioavaility that APIs might face due to unfavourable crystal properties

# Current state of the project:

CSD mining has acheived a dataset of small organic molecules which are being used to predict crystal habit with random forest classification models.

# Next steps:

1. Investigate other types of models to optimise performance
2. Mine associated literature to obtain crucial metadata - temp/pressure/concentrations etc.
